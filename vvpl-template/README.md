# Team work / work division
We do pair programming, i.e. we use the VSCode extension Live Share to program side by side.
We work on functions together and work through problems together, and as such are unable to
divide which functions were made by whom as we both participated in the creating and betterment 
of each function.
We will attempt to interchangibly push to gitLabs.
