# Team work / work division
We do pair programming, i.e. we use the VSCode extension Live Share to program side by side.
We work on functions together and work through problems together, and as such are unable to
divide which functions were made by whom as we both participated in the creating and betterment 
of each function.
The only code done seperately is the ASTPrinter.java which was done by Sandra and the Expr.java and Stmt.java done by Sofie. 
We have attempted to interchangibly push to gitLabs.

# Requirements
Java 7 or above is required for our program to function correctly.
